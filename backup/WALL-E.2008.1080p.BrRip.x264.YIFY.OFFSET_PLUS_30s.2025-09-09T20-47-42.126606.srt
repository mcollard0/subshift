00:37:46,449 --> 00:37:47,409
Huh?

190
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,639
EVE!

191
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:54,909
Huh?

192
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,510
Foreign contaminant.

193
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:22,269

194
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,570
EVE!

195
00:40:00,809 --> 00:40:02,179
I've been in my cabin all morning,

196
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,809
so let's hover over to the driving range
and hit a few virtual balls into space.

197
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,409
No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

198
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:13,289
- Well, then what do you want to do?
- I don't know. Something.

199
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,090
Whoa!

200
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:25,869
Look, I'm tired of having
the same argument over and over.

201
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,739
Bot, over here.

202
00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:38,550
Whoa!

203
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:47,519
I'm in a tunnel. I can't hear you.
- There you are.

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,809

215
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:19,889
What's that? What's going on?

216
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,760
WALL-E.

217
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,289
Uh...

Uh, no. John.

221
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:36,230

Ooh!

232
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,809
Love blue.

233
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,849
Date?

234
00:42:18,949 --> 00:42:20,179
Don't get me started on the date.

235
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:23,880
Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

236
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:28,820
If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

237
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:30,730
There are no good men out there.

238
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,989
I know. I know because I've...

00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:35,090

Huh?

00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,130
Yoo-hoo. WALL-E.

00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:18,679
Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.

275
00:46:27,630 --> 00:46:29,789
<i>Well, good morning, everybody,</i>

276

<i>Oh, I see the ship's log is showing

Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?

336
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,010
Maybe we missed a step.

341
00:50:45,219 --> 00:50:46,519
Why don't you scan her to be sure?

342
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,869
Contains no specimen.
Probe's memory is faulty.

343
00:50:57,969 --> 00:51:02,699
- So then, we're not going to Earth?
- Negative.

344
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,070
I guess things go back to normal, huh?

345
00:51:05,179 --> 00:51:06,969
Correct, Captain.

346
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:09,170
<i>- Well, false alarm!
- False alarm.</i>

347
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:13,150

348
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:16,909
GO-4, send her to the repair ward,

349
00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:20,460

Hmm.

362
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,369
Define "earth."

363

<i>Earth, the surface of the world</i>

These are called "farms."

01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:03,659
Humans would put seeds

- What's it like now?
- Oh!

478
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:30,909
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I want to see for myself.

479
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,230
Wait. That doesn't look like Earth.

480
01:04:45,159 --> 01:04:46,960
Where's the blue sky?

481
01:04:57,239 --> 01:04:59,039

01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:34,079
Now, the plant.

551
01:09:34,189 --> 01:09:36,149
No. Wait a minute.

552
01:09:36,250 --> 01:09:38,619
<i>Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?</i>

553
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,159
<i>Message received in the year 2110.</i>

554
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,659
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

555
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,789
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

556
01:09:47,899 --> 01:09:50,560
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

557
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:55,609
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

558
01:09:55,710 --> 01:09:59,039
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

559
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,140
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

560
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:04,510
Home, Auto.

561
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:08,350
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

562
01:10:08,449 --> 01:10:09,750
That's all I've ever done.

563
01:10:09,850 --> 01:10:13,149
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

564
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,590
<i>On the Axiom you will survive.</i>

565
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:20,390
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

566
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,010
<i>I'm the captain of the Axiom.</i>

567
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:43,750
We are going home today.

568
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:50,590
GO-4?

569
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,359
Hey! That's not...

570
01:11:23,460 --> 01:10:56,020
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

571
01:11:02,310 --> 01:11:06,140
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

572
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:07,829
No!

573
01:11:18,119 --> 01:11:19,149
Huh?

574
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,359
- EVE?
- WALL-E!

575
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:25,119
EVE!

576
01:11:26,729 --> 01:11:27,960
- Oh!
- WALL-E, the plant!

577
01:11:28,069 --> 01:11:29,460
- WALL-E!
- Over here. Throw it.

578
01:11:29,569 --> 01:11:30,529
Ahhh!

579
01:11:30,899 --> 01:11:31,869
EVE!

580
01:11:33,069 --> 01:11:34,659
Give me the plant.

581
01:11:51,159 --> 01:11:52,890
WALL-E!

582
01:12:03,029 --> 01:12:05,300
All communications are terminated.

583
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:07,060
You are confined to quarters.

584
01:12:07,170 --> 01:12:08,500
No! Mutiny!

585
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:10,170
Mutiny!

586
01:12:29,689 --> 01:12:30,649

593
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,930

600
01:14:04,449 --> 01:14:05,680
Whoa.

601
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:15,520

M-O.

606
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:02,869

Earth? Earth!

616

617
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:34,260
Wrong.

618
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,069
Please hold.
We are currently having...

619
01:16:50,649 --> 01:16:51,609
EVE!

620
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:52,699
Whoops.

621
01:16:52,819 --> 01:16:54,880
<i>Caution. Rogue robots.</i>

<i>- Not possible.

627
01:17:42,029 --> 01:17:43,800
Auto! Auto!

628
01:17:43,899 --> 01:17:45,770
Mutiny. Mutiny.

629
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:48,829
Stupid wheel.

630
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:51,170

The plant!

634
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,550
We'll see who's powerless now.

635
01:18:09,560 --> 01:18:12,029

Is this thing on?</i>

636
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:17,529

638
01:18:22,010 --> 01:18:24,630

639
01:18:24,739 --> 01:18:27,439
<i>- Auto's probably going to cut me off...

Ah!

641
01:18:30,750 --> 01:18:31,840
Halt.

Oh, my.

643
01:18:34,989 --> 01:18:36,109

644
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:38,880
Oh!

645
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:42,180
Halt, halt.

646
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:53,199
<i>- Look what I got, Auto.
- Not possible.</i>

647
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:56,859
That's right. The plant.

01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,699
<i>You want it? Come and get it, blinky.</i>

649
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,630
No.

650
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:08,420
Captain? Captain?

651
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:13,550
Let go.

652
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:16,520
- Let go.
- Too heavy for you? Huh?

653
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,060
Get off.

654
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:21,819
You're not getting away
from me, one-eye.

655
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,899
- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

656
01:19:38,079 --> 01:19:39,140
Halt.

657
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:44,720
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

658
01:19:44,819 --> 01:19:46,760
- Not good.
- Got you.

659
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:13,439
Whoa!

660
01:20:23,489 --> 01:20:26,489
Remain calm. Remain calm.

661
01:20:36,970 --> 01:20:40,029

Ah!

665
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:54,680
Enough.

666
01:21:00,329 --> 01:21:01,890
Hey. What? John?

667
01:21:02,329 --> 01:21:03,770
Whoa!

668
01:21:21,319 --> 01:21:22,720
No! No, no, no!

736
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:26,939

you'd escaped from routine #</i>

737
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:33,079

738
01:32:35,289 --> 01:32:37,819

739

754
01:33:35,819 --> 01:33:38,479
<i># We learned to live off the good land #</i>

755
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:42,119
<i># We learned to climb up a tree #</i>

756
01:33:43,930 --> 01:33:46,489
<i># Then we got up on two legs #</i>

757
01:33:48,199 --> 01:33:50,720
<i># But we wanted to fly #</i>

758
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:54,800

our homeland #</i>

759
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,729
